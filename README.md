# ww2airsim

A WWII Pacific air combat simulator that runs in the browser. Fly an F6F
Hellcat from carrier and land bases over a geographically real Leyte Gulf,
fight, and get back aboard — because your score does not count until you do.

Inspired by *Hellcats Over the Pacific* (Graphic Simulations, 1991) and its
*Missions at Leyte Gulf* expansion. Clean-room: no original code, assets, or
mission text. `ww2airsim` is a working title.

## Status

**Design complete, no implementation yet.** The full design lives in
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-ww2airsim-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-ww2airsim-design.md)
and is the authoritative description of this project — read it rather than
inferring intent from the code, of which there currently is none.

## What this is, and is not

This is a technical playground; the engineering is the point. Depth is
allocated unevenly and on purpose:

| Area | Depth |
| --- | --- |
| World and terrain — real DEM and bathymetry, LOD streaming, 60–100 km views | Deep |
| Graphics — WebGPU, cascaded FFT ocean, volumetric cloud | Deep |
| Flight physics — honest forces, simplified moments | Good enough |
| Combat AI — pursuit, energy awareness, a small maneuver set | Basic |
| Content — eight scenarios, six aircraft | Minimal |

Explicitly not in scope: multiplayer, a persistent strategic campaign,
study-level aerodynamics, mobile, or VR.

## Requirements

A WebGPU-capable Chromium. There is no WebGL2 fallback in v1, though the
renderer boundary keeps one possible without touching the simulation.

## Architecture in one line

`sim/` never imports `render/` and never touches a browser global. That single
constraint is what makes ~90% of the logic testable headlessly in Node, and
what lets an AI pilot fly the player's seat in end-to-end tests.
